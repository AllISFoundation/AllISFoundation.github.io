# All IS Foundation

[All IS Foundation](http://allis.foundation) is dedicated to spiritual research to facilitate inner progress within individuals, by providing a home, tools, and guidance for one seeking to reach higher levels of consciousness.

To enable measuring of an individual’s—and humanity’s—relation to God’s light of consciousness, making the invisible visible through *quantifiable* instruments (*W.I.P.*).

Towards these goals, a series of 2018 research papers has recently been published:

1. Proposing an idea for [a simple, scalable, cheap, energy-free, water desalination solution](http://allis.foundation/Solar_Ignition_Water_Vaporizer.pdf) to provide for mankind’s fresh water needs to beyond the next century.
2. A [1](http://allis.foundation/The_Mystery_of_Larsons_Cross.pdf) [2](http://allis.foundation/The_Light_of_Larsons_Cross.pdf) [3](http://allis.foundation/The_Zygospore_of_Larsons_Cross.pdf) & [4](http://allis.foundation/Rendering_a_Star.pdf) part series exloring [a new interpretation](http://allis.foundation/The_Mystery_of_Larsons_Cross.pdf) of [Dewey B. Larson’s Reciprocal System of Theory](http://reciprocalsystem.org) (which explains the process of universe’s creation from a perspective of motion). His original formula is re-evaluated as *1=s/t*, and proves God’s light as the origin of all that is—in scientific, philosophical and spiritual context—along with photographic evidence to support this new claim. 
3. Another [~50 research papers](http://allis.foundation/All_IS_Foundation.pdf), compiling content from various sources between 2012-2018, which may provide deeper insight into any particular theme—with light and higher consciousness as the prevailing consideration—relevant to the world we live in today...  Applicable to deeper understanding of the world as it *is*.

The All IS Foundation was originally started to provide an umbrella for the [Light in Life™](http://lightinlife.online) online project, which will eventually develop into a full-fledged technical web-app, providing a platform for LiL™ guides, counselors, healers, and mystics to counsel Self-healing users online.

For now, due to this author’s current circumstances, this project is temporarily on hold, and will resume when adequate support is available to pursue it in earnest...

## Light in Life™

[Light in Life™](http://lightinlife.online) is AISF’s standard for inner self healing designed to be a practical reference for all, enabling anyone willing to measure their karmic progress in relation to God’s spiritual perfection. 

With the help of a guide, LiL™ effectively combines practical tools for inner guidance to enable a person to heal their Self, and overcome long-standing issues and problems of a spiritual nature.

The LiL™ standard was created following a self-healer's personal recovery experience—reforming a life from the influence of toxic emotions, substance need and self-destructive tendencies to light.
